    <h3><u>About</u></h3>
    <p>
        One of the greatest benefits of Odisha‘s vast expanses of the unspoiled natural landscape has been its ability to offer a protected yet natural habitat to the state’s incredible wildlife. Apart from the Nandankanan Zoo and sanctuary and Similipal National Park, there are at least eighteen smaller sanctuaries that are home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, birdlife reptiles and water creatures. Some of the most important experiments of wildlife conservation are taking place in this natural habitat, giving the tourists an excellent opportunity to see nature’s bounty, propagated in an environment that is as healthy as it is beautiful.
